A Skype bot that uses the Skype4COM DLL to communicate with Skype.
Currently developing in a Lua wrapper for the Skype4COM DLL. May or may not change in the future.

## Usage ##

To deploy the bot, just do `start main.cmd` in Command Prompt.
Yes, yes, I do plan to try and port this to Mac and/or Linux in the future.

## Setup ##

Configurations for the bot are stored in `settings.yml` and are written in YAML.
